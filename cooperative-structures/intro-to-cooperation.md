# Cooperation at Founders & Coders: an Introduction

### History

@sofer has long been interested in cooperative structures (in 1988, he founded an organic vegetable-delivery company that became a workers' co-op). 

As explained in [history.md](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/international/blob/master/history.md), at the end of 2014, FAC3 successfully organised a fundraising campaign that enabled Founders & Coders London to move into its current space in Bethnal Green. At the same time, the group decided to incorporate Founders & Coders as a community interest company with directors and a voting membership. Alongside Dan and Ines' leadership as directors, a member-led structure began to take shape, with programme participants and graduates invited to weigh in on most organisational decisions.

In early 2015, FAC3 graduate Will Fischer applied for and won a young cooperator's prize on behalf of Founders & Coders. This prize not only paid rent for a month, but also embedded Founders & Coders in a network of cooperative businesses, providing programme participants graduates with opportunities to attend various gatherings where Founders & Coders members deepened their understanding of cooperative principles.

When Founders & Coders London incorporated as a CIC, there was an attempt to become a cooperative digital agency that would employ programme graduates and generate income to support the educational programme, but for various reasons, this attempt was not a great success. 

The educational programme, however, continued to operate in a cooperative spirit, with programme participants and graduates taking responsibility for most major decisions. Until early 2017, though, the organisation had not defined the terms of membership, nor specified exactly what it meant to take part in cooperative decision-making. 

By the 2017 annual general meeting, the community was hungry for clarity around the organisation's membership structure and decision-making processes. At that meeting, Rebecca led us to adopt a structure for decision-making by consensus designed to support the development of a healthy cooperative community.

### Consensus

Consensus decision making is a style of decision making which requires consent (agreement) by all members of a group for decisions to be approved. 

Consensus is a democratic decision-making process that facilitates collective action. Consensus-based decision making is a structure that engages the whole community in the process of making decisions, and in particular, prevents a majority from dominating or alienating a minority. When consensus must be reached, the community must find a way to address disagreements in a productive manner and identify solutions that all can consent to.

### How does this work in practice?

The decision-making process typically begins with discussions on GitHub. After a period of discussion, a member (or group of members) drafts an issue containing a proposal explaining what they suggest the community do, providing appropriate context and listing action steps.

Members are expected to raise questions/concerns on the issue, so that the writer has time to adjust the proposal to better reflect the will of the whole community. 

The community then votes on the proposal at the monthly business meetings. We encourage you to [read more](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/international/blob/master/consensus-decisions.md) about the consensus process we've developed, to contribute to issues, and to attend monthly business meetings to see the process in action. 

Decision-making can feel messy, especially when the goal is to make decisions that reflect the will of the whole community. As you become a part of this community, we encourage you to reflect on the process we've developed and to suggest ways we can improve it!

### Membership

At the same annual general meeting, London approved a [membership structure](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-membership), which other communities, such as Nazareth, have also adopted.

In most cases, you can become a member of a Founders & Coders programme after attending two business meetings. Members can make proposals, vote on proposals, and join committees (such as finance) with delegated decision-making power.
