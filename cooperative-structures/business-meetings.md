## Business Meetings

#### Purpose of meetings:

- Discussing and voting on proposals (brought by both individuals and committees)
- Voting in new members
- Financial reporting
- Relevant updates

#### Before beginning a meeting:

- Arrange seating in a _circle_ so everyone can see and hear each other during the discussion
- Set up a video conference such as Google Hangouts and share the link on Gitter 

#### Facilitation team assigns roles:

- `Time keeper` - paces the meeting, in particular the 30 minute period allocated to each proposal

- `Minute-taker` - takes notes and uploads them as a file after the meeting

- `Vote counter` - takes attendance and records votes in a Google sheet

- `Tech` - monitors Hangouts and casting

- `Mood monitor` - suggests breaks, checks on anyone who leaves
