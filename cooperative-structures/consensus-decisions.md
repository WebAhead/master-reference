# Founders and Coders Cooperative Decision Making Process  

## Consensus-based decision making

Cooperatively-run communities need democratic decision-making processes that facilitate collective action. Consensus-based decision making is a structure that engages the whole community in the process of making decisions, and in particular, prevents a majority from dominating or alienating a minority. When consensus must be reached, the community must find a way to address disagreements in a productive manner and identify solutions that all can consent to.

## Preparing a proposal for vote:

**NOTE:** This process applies to _both_ decisions made within committees and whole-group decisions made at business meetings

_You have a question or idea and want to know what other members think about it:_
1. Post an issue labeled as a `discussion` in which you explain your idea/suggestion and invite people to comment on the issue
1. Once the issue has generated sufficient discussion, it may prompt action steps. At this time, you can write a `proposal` which will be brought to a meeting

_Guidelines for drafting a `proposal`:_
- Post in it a new issue titled and labeled as a `proposal`
- Reference the `discussion` issue that prompted a proposal
- Explain WHY you are proposing a change/action, WHAT is being proposed, and HOW to move forward
- Assign it to a future committee/business meeting (no sooner than one week in advance)

_Revising a `proposal`:_
- After other members post questions/requests for clarification as comments, the proposal writer should draft a revised version of the proposal accounting for any requested modifications and post it _above_ the original proposal in the top comment (noting the time and date of the revision)
- The proposal writer should make every effort to ensure that the final version of the proposal reflects the will of the community 

## Discussing a proposal at a meeting:

_Timing:_ Each proposal gets up to 30 minute of floor time at a meeting

- At the meeting, the faciliator gives the floor to the proposal writer, who reads aloud each section of the proposal (to ensure all present to vote are fully informed)
- The proposal writer fields requests for clarification from members (minor modifications can be made to the proposal during the meeting, with the `minute-taker` editing the top comment)
- The facilitator's role is to ensure all voices are heard and to determine if and when a proposal is ready for a vote 

## Voting

**Absentions**

Abstentions may be registered by participants who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal, have a personal conflict of interest, or feel they will not be affected by the proposal in question.

**Blocks**

_In most consensus-based processes, blocks can occur under one of two conditions:_
1. The proposal has unresolved issues (possibly because there was insufficient advance discussion and/or the proposal writer did not follow the proposal preparation process)
1. The proposal violates the core values of the organisation

## Outcomes of voting

**Passed**

A passing vote is a vote with no blocks (all yays and abstentions)

_If the proposal is approved:_
- The original proposal maker drafts a final version of the approved proposal (reformatting without WHY/WHAT/HOW), titles it with the proposal name, and creates a pull request to commit the file to the appropriate repository
- The proposal writer actions the items in the HOW section of the proposal (or assigns them to others who volunteered in the meeting)
- Once the document has been reviewed and merged according to the contributing guidelines, the original proposal maker can close the related discussion and proposal issues

**Blocked:**

- Whoever blocked and whoever made the proposal trying to work together to come up with a new proposal 
- Faciliators check in with this group after the meeting to set a time to meet (up to facilitator to determine whether they should be in attendance at this meeting)
