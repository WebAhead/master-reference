These notes are based on the workshop delivered at the mini-bootcamp for FACN4 applicants in Nazareth and also on the coding club I ran at Morpeth School in 2016. See https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/28.  

**Stage 1**
1. Sign up for GitHub.
1. Create a mygithubname.github.io repo
1. Add a single index.html with a single line of text and go to the page
1. Add a link to the page on top of the repo, so it can be found again 

**Stage 2**
1. Sign up for [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/editor/) using your GitHub login ~~c9.io~~
1. Set up a new connection using "Git from URL" and using the appropriate `git@github:` URL from the just-created repo
1. Wait for the connection to be created
1. Open preview (`Run Project`)
1. Open `index.html` and make some edits
1. Refresh the preview to see the changes
1. Open an SSH terminal
1. Type `git status`, then `git commit -am "update index page"` and, finally, `git push`.
1. go back to your GitHub pages website an refresh to see the changes

**Stage 3** (if applying for the programme)
1. Go back to `index.html`, add GitHub, freecodecamp and Codewars links and add a personal statement.
1. Apply for the programme https://foundersandcoders.com/apply/
