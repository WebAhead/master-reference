### Facilitator Standup: July 25, 2017

**Present:** Mavis, Zooey, Finn, Rebecca, Dan, Elias, Jen, Lubes, MG

**Nazareth:**
- Pairing better this week
- When they weren't pairing perfectly, slight nudge helped them
- Some people missing stuff, but all caught up
- Lateness less of an issue

- Discuss cross campus student agreement

**Gaza:**
- API week going slowly
- Combination of people having trouble grasping concepts and maybe less strict time keeping
- Shouldn't be too big of an issue, making sure people get stuff was probably more important
- Switched teams, feels like a good set up for now
- Does Biz Dev make sense in Gaza? GSG fulfil a lot of the roles (discussed this with Saral)
- Next week Zooey and Finn arrive 12pm Sunday, so will miss the node intro code along
- Will be doing less mentoring and more support work for local mentors
- Did some course divergence intentional and unintentional
- Expain object identity instead of software architecture, which also went into software design
- Make Zooey's Object Pass by stuff more explicitly in the course, was touched upon in Nazareth multiple times, and in Gaza, and in London 
  - **AP** raise this as a future curriculum planning issue

**London:**
-- Discuss student pastoral care --

- Switched teams again to make sure everyone is working with each other before the self selection of the second half of the course
  - Nazareth might do the same
- People being 15-20 minutes late every day
  - People think some things aren't a great use of their time so are talking about going home instead
  - Tried a restructure of research afternoon to make people more feel like they can get out of it.
  - Bring something into the student agreement
- Students ask for help a lot. Could be due to the mentors being around more or just the student
  - In Nazareth we have told them to ask someone else first before us
  - Zooey gives people very vague directions and tells them to come
  - Make sure they have 20-20-20'd
  - Zooey points out that in FAC10 people didn't ask enough, so this is probably at least better than that
  - Jen: Because mentors are helping a lot, it is possible people don't feel like they miss out too much if they are late 

**Dan**

- Looking forward to Zooey and Finnn's reflections on delivering the same week 3 times in a row (week 4/node week 1)
- They will have a good idea of any changes that might be needed

**Rebecca**

- 2 campus wide conversations we need to have:
  - Curriculum planning process
  - Content planning for weeks 10-16
- Can next weeks (this call) be extended? Fine by Elias, Mavis, Jen slights towards earlier start - 2:30 until 3

- Maja will be doing week 5 in London then Nazareth, might need help meeting her in Nazareth
