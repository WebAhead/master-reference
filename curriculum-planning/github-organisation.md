# Github organisation

Each new F&C cohort of students should have its own github organisation in which
to store group projects and other materials they co-create throughout the curriculum.

To create a new github organisation please complete the following (using this organisation as an [example](https://github.com/FAC10)):

1. Create a GitHub organisation called `FACN`
2. Create four repositories, and initialise them with a README.md file and a CONTRIBUTING.md file (except for prerequisites-gh-pages):
  + `prerequisites-gh-pages`:
    + [README.md](https://github.com/FAC10/prerequisites-gh-pages/blob/master/README.md)
  + `research`:
    + [README.md](https://github.com/FAC10/research/blob/master/README.md)
    + [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FAC10/research/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  + `morning-challenge-solutions`:
    + [README.md](https://github.com/FAC10/morning-challenge-solutions/blob/master/README.md)
    + [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FAC10/morning-challenge-solutions/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  + `retrospectives`
    + [README.md](https://github.com/FAC10/retrospectives/blob/master/README.md)
    + [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FAC10/retrospectives/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
3. Add FACN as members to the FACN organisation - put them in a team called `students`
4. Give week 1 mentors & directors `owner` rights
5. Add other alumni who will be code reviewing on Fridays - put them in a team called `alumni`

A naming convention is outlined in the [`weekly projects file`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/general/weekly-projects.md)
