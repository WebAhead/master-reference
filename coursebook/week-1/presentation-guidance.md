# What makes a good research presentation

### Presenation Step-By-Step

#### 1. Draw up a plan
+ Take a little time to think about the content. 
+ You’ll need to introduce yourself and your topic.
+ Make some key points and then sum it all up at the end.

#### 2. Choose your tools
+ Try using visual examples.
  + Markdown file
  +  Example code
  +  Images

#### 3. Design Tips
+ Once you’ve decided on the content, you’ll need to present it in a way that’s engaging for people to look at and easy to comprehend.

+ **Just stick to short notes in bullet points** instead of writing out word for word what you want to cover.


#### 4. Practice makes perfect
+ After you’ve finished your first draft, have a trial presenting session. 
  + This can be in front of the mirror, a friend, or even your cat. 
    It’s just a way for you to **get used to speaking out loud and prevent yourself from becoming a waffling mess on the day.**


#### 5. Calm your nerves
+ Even if you’re perfectly prepared and super organised, you’re still likely to get the jitters before you have to present.
+ Just remember that this is entirely normal, and the majority of people feel exactly the same way.

#### 6. Clear and confident
+ A confident presenter doesn’t mumble or talk to the floor.
+ Even if you’re feeling anxious and nervous, lift your head up high and project your voice in a confident manner.
+ Keep your pace steady and don’t rattle along at a lightning speed to get it all over more quickly.
+ Take time to breathe, and treat each slide as a way to have a brief pause. 
+ Having a glass of water to hand is also a good idea.

#### 7. Sum it up
You’ve made it to the end of the presentation. Well done! 

+ You can sum up your main points and bring your presentation to its natural end. 
+ This is your chance to show that you’ve thoroughly researched your topic and thought about your next steps.

#### 8. Round it off
+ Factor in some extra time for a Q&amp;A session at the end.
+  Have a couple of questions up your sleeve that you can ask the audience to get a bit of interaction going, just in case you’re met with a wall of silence.

#### 9. Last but not least 
+ Remember to round off your presentation by ***thanking your audience for listening.***
