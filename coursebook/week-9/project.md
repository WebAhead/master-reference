## Project

Build a server-rendered full-stack app

### Task

- Build an app using the Express framework.
- Use a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
- Use the retrieved data to populate a Handlebars template for _server-side_ rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

### Goals

The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up an Express server and to discover the awesomeness of Handlebars! Spend time considering how to format your layouts, partials and helper functions.

Previous cohorts have built apps where users can share, for example, blog posts, jokes, photos etc. But the app can be about anything as long as you are covering project's technology tasks and goals.

### What's also important:

- Include tests and set up code coverage.
- We expect to see unit tests of pure functions, and integration tests of your server routes, including tests for errors such as 404.
- You should write tests for your database and use a separate test database and build script.
- Use Heroku or a similar service to host the app and the database.
- Try to include ES6 syntax on the server.
