## Preparation

### Students

Go away and think about what you want to build within the scope of a 2 week build. If you want to pitch ideas then choose something you really know about - be the product owners / experts.

When you pitch be prepared to talk for 5-10 minutes about:

- the idea: what problem you are trying to solve.
- who your target users are.
- any relevant background.
- the features you would like to build within the 2 weeks.
- thoughts on what technologies you might use.

### Facilitators

Taken from Google Ventures rules of the game:

- plan for 6 hour days
- no phones or pc’s in the room (you can use in breaks or outside of the space)
- think about re-structuring the space and layout of the room
- make sure you have design materials like sticky notes, sharpies, whiteboards, papers etc
