## “Persona Interview” workshop

### User Research

Understanding is the key to problem solving.
Without a solid grasp on what a problem is, where it originates, and what feeds it, any solution you arrive at will be inadequate. To gain this understanding, you’ll need to conduct user research.

User research helps designers and development teams gain insight into the lives of users, and their needs and wants. This lets them design and build tailored solutions, more effective than those lacking a solid research foundation.

Often, teams are tasked with designing solutions for individuals different to them. Stereotypes and biases can get in the way or cause them to be guided by wrongful notions about their audience. User research also helps them avoid these pitfalls, providing a clear picture of who they are designing for.

So, how do you conduct user research? Different teams use different approaches and tools. With time, you’ll begin to refine existing research processes and might even create your own. In this Exercise, you will learn to conduct user research using a process Frog Design created, called the Research Learning Spiral.

### Research Learning Spiral

The Research Learning Spiral (RLS) is a five-step process that will help you gather knowledge about your users and their needs. The five steps in RLS are:

1. Objectives - Why You Are Conducting Research?
2. Hypothesis - What You Are Looking to Prove?
3. Methods - Selecting Research Methods
4. Conduct - Executing Your Plan
5. Synthesize - Making Sense of Everything

### Personas

Often as part of the UX research process, design teams build a set of imaginary users which are called - Personas.
Personas are representations of clusters of users with similar needs, goals, and behaviors. While a user persona is generally depicted as a single individual, this persona represents a group.

Good personas help communicate and synthesize user research findings. They are realistic and paint a clear picture of a user’s goals, needs, and behaviors. They don’t need to be complicated or long. In fact, succinct, relaxed stories tend to be more effective.

### Exercise:

1) Run through the steps of the Research Learning Spiral in this Exercise.

2) As you go through each step, be sure to organize and properly document your process. You’ll want to share this process with your team later on.

3) Step 3 of the Research Learning Spiral asks you to select a research method based on the kind of information you wish to find.

We would like you to write an imaginary interview for an imaginary user (aka persona).

Why am I doing this?

We thought that instead of making you just write up personas, creating an imaginary user interview for them will be even more fun!

### ‘RLS’ - STEP BY STEP

#### Objectives

Start by answering the “5W + H” (Who, What, When, Where, Why and How) questions:

#### Who am I designing for?

-  
-  
-  
-  
-

———————————————————————————————————————
#### What kinds of tasks and goals will your persona be accomplishing as he/she is using your website or app?

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————
#### When will your persona be engaging with your product?

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————
#### Where will your persona be using what you are designing?

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————
#### Why is your persona choosing to use what you’ve designed and what drives this behaviour?

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————
#### How will they be using it?

-

#### Hypothesis

In a few bullet points- by building this app, what are you looking to prove?

#### Step 3 - Methods

Now that you went through the first two stages of the RLS, write the imaginary interview for your persona.

Divide your interview into three stages, each stage leading to a deeper and more tailored understanding of your persona and their possible use of your app:


1. **Opening questions:** these are meant to ‘warm up’ your interviewee, so for example these could be general questions about his/her jobs, hobbies, habits, life choices ect.


2. **Deeper questions:** Go more into details, ask questions aimed at deeper motivations and needs. These could start to be tailored around the problems that your app is trying to solve.


3. **Specific questions about you app idea:** Questions which are specific to your app idea and how your user may or may not use it. (e.g - if, how, and why the app you are creating would be useful to them.)

Be sure to write down the details about your Persona. Create a profile which includes:

- Name
- Demographics (age, status, location, level of education, etc.)
- Current job title
- Any interests they are willing to share (maybe they play tennis?)

### Conduct

Now its time to take your plan into action!

After you have written your interview, try to ‘step into the shoes’ of your imaginary user and answer those questions as if you were them!

Try to think and impersonate that ‘Persona’, which is basically one archetypical imaginary user of your app. Remember - While a user persona is generally depicted as a single individual, this persona represents a group.

----------

### Synthesis

This is the time and place to make sense of it all. Write in a few bullets points what are possible insights you might have gained. Go back to your Hypothesis - could you say that it is still true? or perhaps by going through the RLS, you find out some surprising facts…

“From the interview I conducted with my Persona, I came across a few interesting findings….”
