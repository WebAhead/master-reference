## GV Sprint Monday

**Monday is basically going to be a lot of standing around a whiteboard and talking to each other.**

You’re going to end the week with a real prototype and some data. This does not mean that you have to make every decision perfectly you just need to keep moving through the sprint. Making your prototype and testing it is going to give you the best possible start to the project.

It’s going to be really tempting to think of solutions immediately, but it’s important to slow down and gradually build up levels of understanding together. Get everyone on the same page before you start focusing on any one part of the problem. It’s a 5 step afternoon.

### Step 1
[ ] Elect (or self-appoint) a facilitator / pen-holder-word-writer
[ ] Facilitator, read this:

#### Facilitator Tips
- **Ask for permission.** Ask the group for permission to facilitate. Explain that you’ll try to keep things moving, which will make the sprint more efficient for everyone.
- **ABC: Always be capturing.** Synthesise the team’s discussion into notes on the whiteboard. Improvise when needed. Keep asking, “How should I capture that?”
- **Ask obvious questions.** Pretend to be naïve (or just be naïve). Ask “Why?” a lot.
- **Take care of the humans.** Keep your team energised. Take breaks every sixty to ninety minutes. Remind people to snack and to eat a light lunch.
- **Decide and move on.** Slow decisions sap energy and threaten the sprint timeline. If the group sinks into a long debate, ask the Decider to make a call.

### Step 2
**Who Are Your Users?**

**Can you define them?**

- User Research
  - Demographic / Quantitative
[ ] Can you make a couple of short user personas?
  - use word if you really want to jeez
[ ] Interview your Personas + [“Persona Interview”](./persona-interview-workshop.md) workshop
- Understand your users on a deeper level
  - Who What Where When Why and How of the users (Frog design - Research Learning Spiral)

### Step 3
**Start at the End**
[ ] **Set a long-term goal.** (writing on the whiteboard)
  - Get optimistic. Ask: Why are we doing this project? Where do we want to be in 6 months, a year, or even 5 years from now? Write the long-term goal on a whiteboard.


[ ] **List sprint questions.** (writing on the whiteboard)
  - Get pessimistic. Ask: How could we fail? Turn these fears into questions you could answer this week. List them on a whiteboard.
  - What are all the things that could trip up our progress to hitting the long-term goal?


[ ] **Make a map.** (drawing on the whiteboard)
  - List your users (customers and key players) on the left.
  - Draw the ending, with your completed goal, on the right.
  - Finally, make a flowchart in between showing how customers interact with your product. Keep it simple: five to fifteen steps.
  - Each of the steps on the flowchart represent a ‘JTBD’.
  - DO NOT “SOLUTIONIZE”
    - Don’t bother with steps like “logs in” / “signs up” / “clicks link”
      - That is a specific way of achieving a goal - we’re not there yet
    - Why are you committing to those solutions when we haven’t properly defined the problem yet?

hopefully this will be about 4pm-ish

### Step 4 STICKY NOTES!
[ ] **How Might We**
  - Ask as many HMW’s of your JTBD’s that you think you can
    - HMWs are about reframing problems as opportunities.
      Listen carefully for problems and use “How might we” phrasing to turn them into opportunities.
  - Group them on the wall into themes (Don’t perfect it. Stop after about ten minutes.)
[ ] **Stakeholders**
  - Who is involved? who is affected?
  - not just users, but who shares the goal
[ ] **Product/process audit**
  - How are those goal currently achieved either by us or by the user themselves
[ ] **Inspirational overview**
  - Who is achieving these goals in related fields?
  - Who inspires you?

### Step 5
**“Okay, so we’re gonna solve this problem”**
[ ] Vote for the winning problem
  - Everyone gets 2 votes (can vote for the same thing twice)
[ ] Finally, decide on a moment to prototype and test.
