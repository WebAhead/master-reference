# Final Project / _Hackathon_ `->` Hard Deadline: Friday 16:00

Once you are _reasonably_ confident in your Elm skills,
it's time to _use_ those super-powers for _good_.

![with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-power-bill-spider-main](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22128364/11eea1ea-de98-11e6-9df2-b97bbb3f7266.jpg)

## _Why_?

### Founders & Coders and all future technology learners need(s) _your_ help!

`while` _we_ have [come a _long_ way]() in the past few years,
there are still _many_ areas of F&C that _can_ be ***improvededed***.

At this point in the "_course_" you will **all** have
(_more than_) "_enough_" **insight** into what
_can_ be _improved_ about F&C and can _articulate_
(_write down_) the most pressing issues because you will have
**_felt_ the _pain_** and had _time_ to _think_ about the problem(s)!

[![no pain no gain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22128589/58c99cd6-de99-11e6-9bb4-91893c594d70.png)](http://giphy.com/search/pain-fail 'feel the pain?')

The group/team projects you have worked on until this point in the "_course_"
have been _demanding_, because you had to acquire _new_ skills `while` you
were building the "thing". This challenge is no _less_ demanding in that it
will require you to ***think creatively*** and produce something _useable_
and _useful_ by the end of the week!
However there is a _key_ difference between this project and previous ones:
you _already_ (_collectively_) have
_more_ than enough technical knowledge/skills
to _build/make_ _anything_ you can imagine,
so this project is simply a matter
of applying skills you have _muscle memory_ for to a new problem.

## _What_?

Founders & Coders is a (_reasonably_) well-defined setup.

[![ines-founders-and-coders-cast-talk-open-hands](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22129408/a7de29f0-de9d-11e6-89ce-475e9d975106.png)](https://youtu.be/jnW7YzZ9GwQ?t=33s)


And we have a good vision for the future (_help still needed/wanted!_)

[![dan-the-future](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22129840/561ad2dc-dea0-11e6-86ca-661c30c28517.png)](https://youtu.be/3oXhmHDDEro)

What we _need_ is to **_leverage_ technology**
and the collective **creativity**, **skills** and **efforts**
of our members to _make_ useful things we which help
us make the Organization _sustainable_.

_Many_ ideas have been discussed in the past and some were _really_ good<sup>1</sup>!

> **Note**: Rather than _telling_ people ***what*** to build we _prefer_ to
point you in the _direction_ of what you _can_ do ...
(_if people **prefer precise requirements/instructions** we can **easily** write those out e.g: https://github.com/dwyl/terminate/issues/29 ... we just think this gives you more of a chance to think and be creative..._)

## _Who_?

+ _Everyone_ in the cohort.
(_this is your last day together as a Cohort,
  before some of you start work on client projects, etc.
  make the most of and enjoy it!_)
+ _Anyone_ `else` in the F&C Community (_both alumni, directors and mentors_!)
that you feel can contribute to _understanding_
the challenge/problem!
Mention people in the issue(s) you create
so there is a "_paper trail_" of who has been "_consulted_",
and ensures as many voices/ideas/insights are represented/captured;
there's a _high_ chance that someone else will have insight
into the challenge/problem you are attempting to solve, _ask_ them!!


## _How_?

Each Step in this process needs to be time-boxed
to avoid running _out_ of time!
A "Hackathon" is about _high-intensity_ and _focus_
not chit-chat and distractions.
Today you will be `done` by ***16:00***.

_Please_ **follow** `.each` of the **Seven Steps**; they are _all_ important. <br />
(_note: the steps are fairly obvious and can be reviewed/revised in
  SGC at the end of the week_)


You will manage your own time to _collectively_
stay focussed on the **end-of-day** goal.
This is a test of your **teamwork** skills
as much as your technical/development skills,
so if someone is "_stuck_" help them get _un stuck_ (_quickly!_).
Cross the "_finish line_" together.
Remember that you don't _need_ a "fully-functioning" app by the end of the day,
but you do need to _deliver something_ that _shows_ ***how*** you _intend_ to
solve the challenge. This can be a simple as comprehensive readme doc
and well described "backlog" of features
which you walk everyone through in your presentation.
Ideally you will produce `.some` sort of prototype (_even a paper one!_)
(_which demonstrates your idea better than words ever could!_)

Without further ado!!

### Step 1: _Discover_ the _Highest Value_ Challenge (25mins)

Thankfully, many of you _already_ know what the *highest value*
"***things we need to fix***" in F&C are ... <br />
so this exercise does not _need_ to take very long.
(_**embrace** the **time constraint** for the brainstorm session!
  Bank the time for a later step!_)

+ Get **Post-its & Sharpies** (_we should have enough in F&C/DWYL
  if you can't find enough stationery, ask!_)

+ Individually or in _pairs_ spend **5 minutes** "_brain storming_" the
***highest value/impact/pain challenges/problems that F&C has/faces***.
Write **one** "issue" per **post-it**.
(_don't "worry" about "wasting" Post-its! they are cheap
compared to how much time/money we are burning by not fixing
F&C's most fundamental problems..._!)
...  5 minutes so don't go over this time
or get distracted "_chatting_" about the potential solutions either;
just define the issue in as few words as possible.

+ **Group** the Post-its on the wall and see what emerges.
this should take no longer than **5 mins**.

### Step 2: _Select_ the Challenge(s) to be _Solved_! (25 mins)

+ As a _cohort_ select the **_highest value_ challenge(s)** from the list
you have collated from your Post-its.
+ _Ensure_ you agree on "Top Four" highest value challenges,
because you will be _self-organising_ into 4 teams to hack
on your chosen idea for the rest of the day!!

### Step 3: _Describe_ the Challenge in a `new` ("Epic") Issue (25mins)

+ ***Search*** through https://github.com/foundersandcoders
using the GitHub Full-text-search to see if there are any _existing_
issues or code that relate to the problem you are trying to solve.

+ `if` there is a reasonably well described issue with a
[problem statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement)
re-cycle it by adding more detail in follow up comments.
it's likely that there is not an _existing_ issue that concisely
captures the problem and includes a _checklist_ linking to sub-issues,
in that `case` create a
[`new` issue!](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/new)

+ Paste links any _existing_ issues stating the problem/challenge
in the `description` of the `new` issue.

> This issue will be our `Epic` with the _broad_/_high-level_ description
of the Challenge/Problem we need to solve.
It will have a checklist that will link to _smaller_ issues.

### Step 4: _Research Existing_ Projects Matching the Challenge (50 mins)

+ Research the _Existing_ Projects
(_both internal to F&C and in the wider Open Source community_)
that are attempting to address the Challenge you are solving!

+ Add links to any _Existing_ Projects in the `new` issue description
(_you created in step 3_)

+ Remember to _never skimp_ on research as it can save you the _most_ time
e.g: you find that someone `else` has solved your problem and you don't _have_
to write _any_ code!

### Step 5: _Use_ Your _Skills_ (TBD hours/mins)

+ Once you have a well-defined problem statement
and have done the initial research, it's time to dive into the "One Day Sprint"!
+ Use _any_/_all_ skills you have accumulated in the past 11.5 weeks
to _produce_ something useful.

### Step 6: _Finish_ by 16:00 on Friday

_Finishing_ something is _hard_.
The whole _point_ of learning "continuous delivery" and the "agile methodology"
is that you can _itterate_ on something over time...
Sadly, the _reality_ is that _everywhere_ you work will have _deadlines_
embrace them to work smarter!

### Step 7: _Present_ to the Group at 16:00 (50 mins)

+ Presentations will follow a similar format to previous weeks.
The _key_ distinction is that today will be _filmed_!!
And you will be able to _embed_ the video in your project README
so that other people can pick up where you leave off!!

> If you are "camera shy" or would prefer not to be filmed _speak up_!

> Note: We will have Stop-Go-Continue as usual for the whole week at 17:00.

# tl;dr

## Process _Matters_ When Working on Projects in Teams

***Only*** by _diligently_ following the [_contributing instructions/process_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
will _any_ meaningful progress be towards making F&C sustainable. ***Specifically***:
+ ***Discuss*** the challenge/idea/suggestion in an `issue` `before` diving into fixing/implementing it!

+ ***Never*** `commit` your changes (_directly_) to `master`
_especially_ without referencing an issue/dicsussion!
It's an _exceptionally_
[***bad habit***](https://youtu.be/zGbOF4UPpfs?t=2m37s)
which just shows
_complete disregard_ for ***clearly communicating*** with your _colleagues_
and _screams_:
"_my contributions don't need to be peer-reviewed
because they are always perfect!_";
***Always*** create a branch/pull request and get _someone_ to review/merge it.

+ ***Test*** your work/code!! It's _easy_ to take for _granted_ that
what we aremaking "just works", but
without tests ***reliability*** is ***impossible***!

+ ***Document/Comment*** your work/code!
"_What gets measured get's `done`_"
add a documentation "badge" to your work:
https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges#documentation

## _Existing_ Internal Projects that _Can_ be _Extended_

<sup>1</sup> A few _promising_ internal projects which could use some
[***help***](https://youtu.be/1PWk3i9WT-8)
to be further developed
to make the F&C _organization_ ***much bettererer***! <br />
projects listed `ORDER BY VALUE_TO_ORG DESC;`

+ ***Cashflow*** https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-money
 ***cash*** is the **lifeblood** of the organization, even if we think
  _being "**poor** is a **good thing**"_ ... knowing **exactly** how much
  money we have in the bank (and in receivables) is **essential**
  for ensuring that everyone knows **precisely** how much we need
  to "keep the lights on".
  + **TODO**: Build a ***live dashboard*** of our _current_ cashflow position,
  clearly display how much cash we have
  vs. how much we (still) need for `this` month
  or any of our other
  [_amazing projects_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme)
  (current or future)
  so that **everyone** in the org/community
  **knows** where we are with our finances at **all times**!_)

+ ***Jobs***: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/fac-jobs-board
Tracking the **Jobs** available to **F&C Graduates** in a systematic way
(_not gitter!_)
is of _high_ value to _both_ this could _restricted_ to members of the F&C community using [GitHub Auth](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github) and could store a person's profile and let people list the types of employers they are looking for.
Yes, it's similar to `{Insert Name of Recruitment Startup Here}`
but the _crucial_ difference is that if we have a _good_ Jobs board which is actively maintained, the revenue from "_placing_" people in jobs goes
to making F&C _sustainable_ not into the BMW Payments for a "Tech Recruiter"... :heart:
> tech recruiters ... how/why is this still a thing?! <br />

![tech-recruiters-why-how](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22128414/5e71e414-de98-11e6-93dc-f63148f0ffa9.png)


+ ***News Letter*** (_mass communication_):
https://github.com/foundersandcoders/old-newsletter
email newsletters are the ***single most effective*** way of communicating
with existing people in a time-shifted
(_because you don't have to be constantly watching the "chat" channel_)
and succinct/focussed way!
This repo appears to be "old" but  
[_does **not contain** an explanation as to WHY
or a
link_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/old-newsletter/tree/baa7dd3778e071c6f31703f658df204475e30a50)
to where the `new` project that solves the "_mass communication_" problem is...

+ ***Knowledge Sharing***: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/resource-sharing
this is the _single_ best way we can help
**future learners _and existing_ members** stay up-to-date with their knowledge,
skills and tools. It's not high "_monetary_" value to F&C in the "_short term_"
but it's of _exceptionally_ high value to the members in both short & long term!
The more people _know_, the more they can achieve, the better it reflects on
all of us! Sharing links to "_thins-of-interest_" in Gitter
is a great way to _lose_ that information.
(_because it only gets seen by a handful of people and then dissapears!_)
It's fine for meetups that are happening on _that_ day,
but myopic for virtually _everything_ `else`.
Let's fix it by making a tool that is "_as easy to use as chat_"
and offers substantially more value to all users!

+ ***Freelance networking and resources***:
https://github.com/foundersandcoders/freelance-networking-and-resources
this _could_ be a _really_ useful resource.
No `code` or "roadmap" in the repo.
but the [issues](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/freelance-networking-and-resources/issues)
indicate good activity.
The way this project can be "_high value_" to F&C
is `if` it feeds jobs into the ***Jobs*** app (_see above_)
but there's a bit of a "Chicken and Egg" issue here...
_Thankfully_ the team working on the project is the _current_ cohort,
so the ideas are still fresh!

+ ***Production Management***: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/chandelier
"_for people who produce_" ...
it is _unclear_ from the
[README.md @ b11b240a549979d31bc8ac66fd46e304b365a4c0](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/chandelier/blob/b11b240a549979d31bc8ac66fd46e304b365a4c0/README.md)
_exactly_ what the project does or is _meant_ to do.
the API suggests
[jobs](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/chandelier/blob/b11b240a549979d31bc8ac66fd46e304b365a4c0/api/routing/routes.js#L38-L41)
and
[products](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/chandelier/blob/b11b240a549979d31bc8ac66fd46e304b365a4c0/api/routing/routes.js#L50-L53)
issues were
[last **updated 12 Oct 2015**](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/chandelier/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
perhaps ask one of the
[contributors](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/chandelier/graphs/contributors)
who are _all_ ***certified geniuses*** and _really_ nice/helpful people!!

+ **Alumni Network(ing) Dinners**: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/monthly
(_regular dinners for Alumni organized by
  [@RonanYeah!](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/monthly/commits/master
  'try to avoid committing directly to master.
  there is always someone who can help review a PR
  which ensures that more people are included/involved
  see: contributing.md ...')
this could be made into a collaborative thing
rather than relying on **one** time-scarce Software Engineer ...
**Tip**: send out a **calendar invite** with the monthly email newsletter
(see second project above)
so people know when/where the next one is, and they can **automatically
add** it to their calendar along with the latest F&C news so they
know what's going on and are "all caught up" before they arrive!
see: [The Todo List](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/monthly/blob/master/INFO.md#to-do)
... not to be **confused** with the [**DWYL lunch/dinners**
which are **Always Vegan & Free**](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/121)_)

As you can _see_ some people _have tried_ to solve _some_ of the
_important_ organizational challenges before ...
with varying degrees of enthusiasm/momentum/success ...
it's a _good_ idea to _extend_ other people's work!
