# Mentorship
At Founders & Coders, _each week is led by a different group of people_ (depending on their expertise and chiefly on their availability).     
We operate as a **collaborative learning environment** encouraging students to try new (to them) things, teach each other and rapidly iterate. We do a lot more **providing direction** and a lot less **teaching/lecturing** than a traditional classroom environment - see our [tips on good mentorship techniques](./mentorship-techniques.md).

Weeks follow [the schedule set out here](../week-schedule.md).

Each week requires:
+ **2 people to lead the week** - see [the role of "mentor"](./the-role.md)
+ **2 more people to be code reviewers** - one for each student group

**Weekends are for consolidating the previous week's learnings**, so _resist the urge_ to give students 'homework' or preparation work for the following week.
