Understanding is the key to problem solving.
Without a solid grasp on what a problem is, where it originates, and what feeds it, any solution you arrive at will be inadequate. To gain this understanding, you’ll need to conduct user research.

User research helps designers and development teams gain insight into the lives of users, and their needs and wants. This lets them design and build tailored solutions, more effective than those lacking a solid research foundation.

Often, teams are tasked with designing solutions for individuals different to them. Stereotypes and biases can get in the way or cause them to be guided by wrongful notions about their audience. User research also helps them avoid these pitfalls, providing a clear picture of who they are designing for.

So, how do you conduct user research? Different teams use different approaches and tools. With time, you’ll begin to refine existing research processes and might even create your own. In this Exercise, you will learn to conduct user research using a process called the Research Learning Spiral, created by [Frog Design.](https://www.frogdesign.com/)

### Research Learning Spiral

The Research Learning Spiral (RLS) is a five-step process that will help you gather knowledge about your users and their needs. The five steps in RLS are:

1. [Objectives - Why You Are Conducting Research?](#objectives)
2. [Hypotheses - What You Are Looking to Prove?](#hypotheses)
3. [Methods - Selecting Research Methods](#methods)
4. [Conduct - Executing Your Plan](#conduct)
5. [Synthesis - Making Sense of Everything](#synthesis)

As you go through each step of the Research Learning Spiral, be sure to organize and properly document your process. You’ll want to share this process with your team later on.

### Objectives

Start by answering the “5W + H” (Who, What, When, Where, Why and How) questions:

**Who** am I designing for?  
(This question helps you to determine prospective audiences for your design work, defining their demographics.)

-  
-  
-  
-  
-

———————————————————————————————————————

**What** kinds of tasks and goals will your persona be accomplishing as he/she is using your website or app?  
(This question clarifies what people might be doing, as well as what they’re using in your website, application or product.)

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————

**When** will your persona be engaging with your product?  
(This question helps you to determine the points in time when people might use particular products or technologies, as well as daily routines and rhythms of behaviour that might need to be explored.)

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————

**Where** will your persona be using what you are designing?  
(This question helps you to determine contexts of use — physical locations where people perform certain tasks or use key technologies — as well as potential destinations on the Internet or devices that a user might want to access.)

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————

**Why** is your persona choosing to use what you’ve designed and what drives this behavior?  
(This question helps you to explain the underlying emotional and rational drivers of what a person is doing, and the root reasons for that behaviour.)

-  
-  
-  
-  
-  

———————————————————————————————————————

**How** will they be using it?  
(This question helps you go into detail on what explicit actions or steps people take in order to perform tasks or reach their goals.)

### Hypotheses

In a few bullet points- by building this app, what are you looking to prove?

### Methods

This step is dedicated towards choosing the best research methods to test your hypothesis and acquire the most validated learning. As a classroom, we will use the same research methods for this design sprint.

The methods we will introduce you to are **secondary research** and **surveying**.

We will also have you construct a **user persona** - or representation of who you think your typical user is - as a means of reflecting on this research.

If you are curious to learn about other research methods in your own time, IDEO has a valuable [directory of methods](http://www.designkit.org/methods).

----------
### Conduct

Now that you have gone through the first two stages of the RLS, let's begin by conducting our chosen research methods.

### Secondary Research
http://www.designkit.org/methods/21

### User Personas
Materials: A4 paper, markers, pens, post-its

Hopefully through your secondary research you have started learning a little about your target service user. It’s time now to come up with your own representation of them - an imaginary user called a persona.

Personas are representations of clusters of users with similar needs, goals, and behaviours. While a user persona is generally depicted as a single individual, this persona represents a group.
Good personas help communicate and synthesise user research findings. They are realistic and paint a clear picture of a user’s goals, needs, and behaviours. They don’t need to be complicated or long. In fact, succinct, relaxed stories tend to be more effective.

Check out this [short blog post](https://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/) about ‘Personas’ from mailchimp’s UX research team.

**TASK:**
In your team hang up on the wall an A1 piece of paper and on it draw an imaginary user persona based upon your findings and speculations so far. Using either post-its or pens write around the character, fleshing them out, their story, in as much detail as possible.

- Who are they? Where are they from?
- What are their goals and motivations?
- What are their frustrations? How are they feeling?
- What are their aspirations?
- Things they like/dont like
- Technology- apps and social networks they might use

**Do not worry if this exercise feels contrived.** If it does, it is likely you haven’t done enough research yet to know your service user in realistic detail. The point of creating a user-persona is to come up with your best guess as to who your user is based on what we know right now. We all have to start somewhere.

When we do user-testing and surveying later in the week you will have the chance to verify and reflect on how accurate your hypothesis are. A user-persona isn’t a static creation you do once - it’s a dynamic representation of your own understanding that you return to and modify as it develops.

### Surveying

Divide your interview into three stages, each stage leading to a deeper and more tailored understanding of your persona and their possible use of your app:


1. **Opening questions:** these are meant to ‘warm up’ your interviewee, so for example these could be general questions about his/her jobs, hobbies, habits, life choices ect.


2. **Deeper questions:** Go more into details, ask questions aimed at deeper motivations and needs. These could start to be tailored around the problems that your app is trying to solve.


3. **Specific questions about you app idea:** Questions which are specific to your app idea and how your user may or may not use it. (e.g - if, how, and why the app you are creating would be useful to them.)

Be sure to write down the details about your Persona. Create a profile which includes:

- Name
- Demographics (age, status, location, level of education, etc.)
- Current job title
- Any interests they are willing to share (maybe they play tennis?)

Check out these great short articles about conducting user interviews:

* [5 steps to creating good user interview questions](https://medium.com/interactive-mind/5-steps-to-create-good-user-interview-questions-by-metacole-a-comprehensive-guide-8a591b0e2162)
* [User interviews - the beginner's guide](http://theuxreview.co.uk/user-interviews-the-beginners-guide/)

**TASK:**
Now its time to take your plan into action!

After you have written your interview, try to ‘step into the shoes’ of your imaginary user and answer those questions as if you were them!

Try to think and impersonate that ‘Persona’, which is basically one archetypical imaginary user of your app. Remember - While a user persona is generally depicted as a single individual, this persona represents a group.

----------

### Synthesis

This is the time and place to make sense of it all. Write in a few bullets points what are possible insights you might have gained. Go back to your Hypothesis - could you say that it is still true? Or perhaps by going through the RLS, you may find out some surprising facts…

“From the interview I conducted with my Persona, I came across a few interesting findings….”
