## Mentor preparation
In order to prepare, go through the [virtual crash course video](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/virtual-crash-course-video) from the Institute of Design at Stanford.

The following has been taken from ["how to kick off a crash course"](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/gear-up-how-to-kick-off-a-crash-course).

Read through the [facilitator notes](./GiftGiving-FacilitatorNotes.pdf) so you are clear about what students should be doing for each step of the process.

### Preparing the classroom

Buy the following materials:
- scissors
- foil
- masking tape
- lollipops
- glue sticks
- brown paper
- coloured paper

Arrange the tables in the room to enable face-to-face interaction between students.

Print one [set of worksheets](../GiftGiving-Worksheets.pdf) for each student.

### Delivering the workshop

Have [the facilitator notes](./GiftGiving-FacilitatorNotes.pdf) open on your laptop while the students are completing each exercise.

Use the projector to display a stopwatch (e.g. [timeme](http://www.timeme.com)) as the minutes count down. The following intervals have been set for you:
+ [3min:](http://www.timeme.com/timer.htm?17px07ps0s10660501/Stopwatch)
+ [4min:](http://www.timeme.com/timer.htm?17pyo7ps0s10660501/Stopwatch)
+ [10min:](http://www.timeme.com/timer.htm?17q8o7ps0s10660501/Stopwatch)
