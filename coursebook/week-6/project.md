# Database week project

Your project this week is to build a web app that stores data in a PostgreSQL database.

## User stories

### Core

- **As a user, I want to**: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- **As a user, I want to**: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there

Since this project is open-ended you'll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Don't use previous projects
- [ ] **Avoid pokemon themed content**
- [ ] A form for users to submit data
- [ ] A page showing all the data
- [ ] A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
- [ ] A schema describing your database in your README
- [ ] Not process user input as SQL commands
- [ ] Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

#### Stretch criteria

- [ ] A way to view filtered/sorted data, instead of just all of it

## Example project ideas

- Founders & Coders book sharing system
- Food / coffee recommendations around Founders & Coders
- Founders & Coders events calendar
