# Research Afternoon

## Command Line
1. What is the command line?
2. Why might you want to customize it?
3. Research how to:
  + customise your command line to make it pretty and useful (ie. git branch/branch status parser)
  + install using a package manager
4. Create a "workshop", designed to walk the rest of your cohort through the steps (this doesn't need to be long - just one markdown file)

## Regular Expressions
1. What is regex? Why would I use it? What are some examples of common regex usage?
2. Research:
  + How to use regex
    + (basic) pattern creation and repetitions
    + (advanced) groups
  + Find and use on-line tools such as [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
2. Create a code snippet using regex such as (for example) email validator:
+ us3r1@foundersandcoders.com
  + user must start with an alphabetical character;
  + user can contain also other characters (which ones?);
  + site and user are always separated by a snail/small duck/AT symbol (@);
  + site is always done with at least 3 alphabetical characters, a dot and at least 2 more alphabetical characters

## Git
1. What is origin ? _eg. `git push origin master`_
2. How can you find the current origin ? and How can you change the origin's url ?
3. How to merge between 2 branches using `git merge` ? 
  What would happen if you do `git merge master current-branch` 
4. different uses of `git-reset`.
5. Talk about and give a demo of the following commands, when would you use each one?:
    - `git stash` & `git stsah pop`
    - `git diff`
    - `git log`
    - `git fetch` 

## Advanced JavaScript
1. Value vs. reference types in JavaScript
2. `==` vs. `===`
3. Scope
    - What are the different types of scopes 
    - How does the scope affect variables and variable decleration
4. Closures
    - What are closures?
    - How do closures affect the scope?
5. Clean code concepts

  Write a **demo** or **tutorial** on each of the topics above, best to show how you can use some of the concepts in code.
